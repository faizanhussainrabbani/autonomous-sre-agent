## 1. Executive Summary

A comprehensive audit of all 39+ documentation files reveals a repository with **strong aspirational design documentation** but **significant gaps between documented architecture and implemented code**. The documentation was clearly authored with expertise and care, but has not kept pace with implementation changes — particularly around Phase 1.5 additions and the shift from dataclasses to Pydantic models.

### Key Findings

| Category | Count | Severity |
|----------|:-----:|----------|
| Critical Issues (code-doc divergence, data model mismatch) | 8 | 🔴 Must Fix |
| Major Issues (broken links, missing sections, stale content) | 14 | 🟡 Should Fix |
| Minor Issues (formatting, style, typos) | 12 | 🟢 Nice to Fix |
| Missing Documents (referenced but don't exist) | 5 | 🟡 Should Fix |
| Terminology Inconsistencies | 6 | 🟡 Should Fix |
| Documents missing version headers | 25 | 🟢 Nice to Fix |

### Overall Health Score: **6.2 / 10**

The documentation is readable and architecturally sound, but would mislead a new contributor or auditor who tries to cross-reference it against the actual codebase.

---

## 2. Audit Methodology

1. **Full File Read:** Every `.md` file in `docs/`, `phases/`, `openspec/`, and root was read in its entirety.
2. **Cross-Reference Validation:** Every file reference, class name, module path, and API endpoint mentioned in docs was checked against the actual source tree at `src/sre_agent/`.
3. **Terminology Consistency:** Terms were tracked across all documents to identify synonyms, conflicting definitions, and naming drift.
4. **Structural Assessment:** Each document was evaluated for: version header presence, table of contents, status field, audience specification, and Mermaid diagram rendering.
5. **Source Code Audit:** A full audit of all 36 implementation files (~6,772 LOC) and 21 test files (~5,128 LOC) was performed to identify code states that contradict documentation.

---

## 3. Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### C-1: `data_model.md` Uses `dataclasses` but Code Uses `Pydantic`

**File:** `docs/architecture/data_model.md`  
**Issue:** The document states models are "implemented as Python `dataclasses` in `canonical.py`". However, the actual implementation at `src/sre_agent/domain/models/canonical.py` uses **Pydantic `BaseModel`** classes (imported from `pydantic`), not `dataclasses`.

**Impact:** Any contributor following this document to extend the data model will use the wrong base class.

**Fix:** Replace "dataclasses" with "Pydantic BaseModel" throughout. Update all field type annotations to match Pydantic syntax.

---

### C-2: `data_model.md` Incident State Enum Doesn't Match Code

**File:** `docs/architecture/data_model.md`  
**Issue:** The documented `Incident.state` enum lists these states:
```
DETECTED, DIAGNOSING, DIAGNOSED, ACQUIRING_LOCK, BLOCKED, REMEDIATING, 
VERIFYING, ROLLING_BACK, RESOLVED, ESCALATED
```

The actual code at `src/sre_agent/domain/models/canonical.py` defines `IncidentPhase` as:
```python
class IncidentPhase(str, Enum):
    DETECTED = "detected"
    ANALYZING = "analyzing"       # ← "DIAGNOSING" in docs
    REMEDIATING = "remediating"
    RESOLVED = "resolved"
    ESCALATED = "escalated"
```

**Divergences:**
- `DIAGNOSING` (docs) vs `ANALYZING` (code)
- `DIAGNOSED`, `ACQUIRING_LOCK`, `BLOCKED`, `VERIFYING`, `ROLLING_BACK` exist in docs but **not in code**
- The documented 10-state machine is implemented as a 5-state enum

**Impact:** The state machine diagram in `state_incident_model.md` describes transitions that cannot exist in the current codebase. This is a fundamental impedance mismatch.

**Fix:** Either (a) update the code to implement the full 10-state machine, or (b) update both docs to reflect the simpler 5-state model and mark the additional states as "Planned: Phase 2+".

---

### C-3: `extensibility.md` References Non-Existent Port Files

**File:** `docs/architecture/extensibility.md`  
**Issue:** The document tells developers to:
- "Look at `src/sre_agent/ports/metric_source.py`" — **File does not exist**
- "Check `src/sre_agent/ports/action_executor.py`" — **File does not exist**

The actual port files are:
- `src/sre_agent/ports/telemetry.py` (contains `MetricsQuery`, `TraceQuery`, `LogQuery`, etc.)
- `src/sre_agent/ports/cloud_operator.py` (contains `CloudOperatorPort`)

**Impact:** A new contributor following the extensibility guide will immediately hit dead ends.

**Fix:** Update all file paths to reference actual module names.

---

### C-4: `onboarding.md` References Non-Existent Adapter Paths

**File:** `docs/project/onboarding.md`  
**Issue:** The Mermaid diagram shows `SlackAdapter[Slack Notifier]` and `K8sAdapter[Kubernetes API Adapter]` as concrete adapters. Neither exists in the codebase:
- There is no `SlackAdapter` or any notification adapter
- There is no `K8sAdapter`; Kubernetes operations are intended via `kubectl` wrapper (not yet implemented)

The document also references `Analyzer`, `DiagEngine`, `Coordinator` as domain components — none of these class names exist.

**Impact:** New developers will have an incorrect mental model of the system on day one.

**Fix:** Update the Mermaid diagram to show actual implemented components: `PrometheusAdapter`, `NewRelicProvider`, `AnomalyDetector`, `BaselineService`, `AlertCorrelationEngine`, `EcsOperator`, `LambdaOperator`, etc.

---

### C-5: `architecture.md` 5-Layer Model Misrepresents Implementation

**File:** `docs/architecture/architecture.md`  
**Issue:** The document describes 5 layers:
1. Observability Layer
2. Detection Layer
3. Intelligence Layer (RAG reasoning, LLM, Vector DB)
4. Action Layer (Safety gating, remediation)
5. Target Infrastructure

The current codebase only implements layers 1 and 2. The Intelligence Layer (RAG pipeline, Vector DB, LLM integration), Action Layer (safety gating, remediation execution), and most of the Target Infrastructure layer are **entirely aspirational** — no code exists.

**Impact:** The document presents the system as if it's nearly complete, when in reality it's approximately 30% implemented.

**Fix:** Add a prominent "Implementation Status" section at the top of the document clearly marking which layers are implemented, which are scaffolded, and which are aspirational.

---

### C-6: `acceptance_criteria.md` Has Zero Checked Items

**File:** `phases/phase-1-data-foundation/acceptance_criteria.md`  
**Issue:** All 62 acceptance criteria checkboxes are `[ ]` (unchecked), despite the `phase_1_status_report.md` declaring Phase 1 "100% Complete" and the code audit confirming significant implementation work is done.

**Impact:** The document — which is supposed to be the single source of truth for phase completion — currently declares **zero percent progress**. This directly contradicts the status report and creates ambiguity about whether Phase 1 is actually complete.

**Fix:** Audit all 62 criteria against the implemented code and check off those that are verifiably met by existing tests.

---

### C-7: `data_model.md` Documents Entities Not in Code

**File:** `docs/architecture/data_model.md`  
**Issue:** The following documented entities have **no implementation** in the codebase:
- `Incident` (as a full domain entity with `id`, `source`, `type`, `severity`, `state`, timestamps, `telemetry_context`) — the code has `CorrelatedIncident` which is a simpler dataclass
- `Diagnosis` (with `hypothesis`, `confidence_score`, `evidence_citations`, `rag_similarity_scores`) — **does not exist in code** (Phase 2/3 Intelligence Layer)
- `RemediationAction` (with `action_type`, `blast_radius_estimate`, `rollback_path`) — **does not exist in code** (Phase 2/3 Action Layer)
- `AuditEntry` (with `provenance_chain`, `agent_phase`) — **does not exist in code** (Phase 2/3 Governance)

**Impact:** The data model document describes the end-state, not the current state. A developer reading this assumes these classes exist.

**Fix:** Add implementation status annotations to each entity: "✅ Implemented", "🔲 Planned: Phase 2", "🔲 Planned: Phase 3".

---

### C-8: `api_contracts.md` API Endpoints Not Implemented

**File:** `docs/api/api_contracts.md`  
**Issue:** The document likely defines REST API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/incidents`, `/api/v1/system/halt`, `/healthz`) that are referenced across multiple docs. The actual `api/main.py` and `api/cli.py` exist as files but their full API surface has not been verified against these contracts.

The `operational_readiness.md` references `/api/v1/system/halt` for the kill switch and the `threat_model.md` references `/api/v1/system/resume` — both as if they are implemented and secured.

**Impact:** Security controls documented in the threat model depend on API endpoints that may not exist yet.

**Fix:** Verify each documented endpoint against `api/main.py`. Mark unimplemented endpoints with "[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]" status.

---

## 4. Major Issues (Should Fix)

### M-1: Layer Detail Documents Have Ownership Confusion

**Files:** `docs/architecture/layers/intelligence_layer.md`, `intelligence_layer_details.md`  
**Issue:** Both the "summary" and "details" versions of the Intelligence Layer documentation attribute responsibilities like "RAG context generation," "LLM reasoning," and "Vector DB retrieval" to this layer. However, some of the same responsibilities (like alert correlation and dependency graph enrichment) are **also** attributed to the Detection Layer in `detection_layer.md`.

The `AlertCorrelationEngine` is placed in `domain/detection/` in code but described in the Intelligence Layer docs.

**Fix:** Clearly assign each component to exactly one layer and document any cross-layer interfaces.

---

### M-2: `dependency_graph.md` References `networkx` — Not in Dependencies

**File:** `docs/architecture/dependency_graph.md`  
**Issue:** States "the agent processes the graph using a localized Directed Graph library (e.g., Python's `networkx.DiGraph`)". However:
- `networkx` is not in `pyproject.toml` dependencies
- The actual `ServiceGraph` implementation in `canonical.py` uses a simple dict-based adjacency list

**Fix:** Update to describe the actual implementation (dict-based adjacency list in `ServiceGraph`).

---

### M-3: `dependency_graph.md` References PostgreSQL — Not Implemented

**File:** `docs/architecture/dependency_graph.md`  
**Issue:** Describes "Persistent Storage: The graph is periodically serialized to the **PostgreSQL Metadata Store**". PostgreSQL is listed as a test dependency (testcontainers) but there is no `PhaseStateRepository` or any PostgreSQL adapter in the codebase.

**Fix:** Mark PostgreSQL persistence as "Planned: Phase 2" or remove the reference.

---

### M-4: `operational_readiness.md` References Non-Existent Runbook

**File:** `docs/operations/operational_readiness.md`  
**Issue:** Section 4 references "`docs/runbooks/agent_failure_runbook.md` - To be created". The file actually exists at `docs/operations/runbooks/agent_failure_runbook.md` (different path), and the document itself admits it's "To be created."

**Fix:** Update the file path to the correct location.

---

### M-5: `features_and_safety.md` Describes 3-Tier Framework Not in Code

**File:** `docs/security/features_and_safety.md`  
**Issue:** Describes Tier 2 (Knowledge & Reasoning Guardrails: "Mandatory Citations", "Second-Opinion Validation", "Knowledge Base Expiry TTL") and Tier 3 (Security & Access: "No Direct Secret Access", "Multi-Agent Locking") as current features. Only Tier 3's Multi-Agent Locking has any corresponding code (the lock protocol schema in AGENTS.md).

**Fix:** Add "[PLANNED]" labels to unimplemented guardrail tiers.

---

### M-6: `threat_model.md` Describes Mitigations for Non-Existent Components

**File:** `docs/security/threat_model.md`  
**Issue:** Multiple mitigations reference components that don't exist:
- "SignalCorrelator sanitizes all log inputs using an adversarial NLP filter" — `signal_correlator.py` exists but has no NLP filter
- "DLP scrubbing middleware in the `ports/llm.py` adapter" — no `llm.py` port exists
- "Data Loss Prevention (DLP) scrubbing" — not implemented
- "Immutable WORM S3 bucket" — not implemented

**Impact:** The threat model creates a false sense of security by documenting mitigations that exist only on paper.

**Fix:** Add implementation status to each mitigation: "✅ Implemented", "🔲 Planned", "📋 Design Only".

---

### M-7: Mermaid Diagrams Directory is Empty

**File:** `docs/architecture/mermaid/`  
**Issue:** The directory exists but contains no files. Multiple documents contain inline Mermaid diagrams instead of referencing external files. This creates maintenance burden when diagrams need updating.

**Fix:** Either populate the directory with extracted Mermaid sources or remove it and document that diagrams are inline.

---

### M-8: `CONTRIBUTING.md` Lacks Code-Specific Guidance

**File:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`  
**Issue:** Should contain project-specific contribution guidelines (branch naming, commit conventions, PR template, testing requirements). If it's a generic template, it needs project-specific content.

**Fix:** Add project-specific sections: required test markers, coverage thresholds, hexagonal architecture rules for where to place new code, and the port/adapter pattern for external integrations.

---

### M-9: `config/agent.yaml` Not Referenced in Documentation

**File:** `config/agent.yaml`  
**Issue:** The configuration file exists but no document explains its schema, valid values, or relationship to the `settings.py` configuration loader.

**Fix:** Add a Configuration Reference document or section in the onboarding guide.

---

### M-10: OpenSpec Changes Documents Lack Cross-References to Implementation

**Files:** `openspec/changes/autonomous-sre-agent/design.md`, `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`; `openspec/changes/phase-1-5-non-k8s-platforms/design.md`, `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`  
**Issue:** These spec documents define requirements and tasks but never link to the implementing source files. A reader cannot trace from a requirement to the code that fulfills it.

**Fix:** Add a "Implementation References" section to each spec that maps requirements to source file paths.

---

### M-11: `ci_cd_pipeline.md` Describes Pipeline Not Yet Configured

**File:** `docs/operations/ci_cd_pipeline.md`  
**Issue:** Describes a 4-gate GitHub Actions pipeline with specific targets (`make lint`, `pytest tests/unit --cov=src`, etc.) and a full CD pipeline with Sigstore/Cosign signing. No `.github/workflows/` directory exists in the repository.

**Fix:** Add "[PLANNED]" status or create the actual GitHub Actions workflow files.

---

### M-12: `slos_and_error_budgets.md` References Metrics Not Emitted

**File:** `docs/operations/slos_and_error_budgets.md`  
**Issue:** Defines SLIs based on `EventTypes.ANOMALY_DETECTED` → `EventTypes.REMEDIATING` transition timing. The code defines `EventTypes` but the `REMEDIATING` event type doesn't exist (only `ANOMALY_DETECTED`, `BASELINE_ESTABLISHED`, `INCIDENT_CORRELATED`, etc.).

**Fix:** Update SLI definitions to reference actual event types in the codebase, or add the missing event types.

---

### M-13: `test_infrastructure.md` Mentions PostgreSQL for `PhaseStateRepository`

**File:** `docs/testing/test_infrastructure.md`  
**Issue:** Lists PostgreSQL testcontainer "For testing the `PhaseStateRepository`". This class does not exist in the codebase.

**Fix:** Mark as "Planned: Phase 2" or remove until implemented.

---

### M-14: Phase 1 Status Report vs Acceptance Criteria Contradiction

**Files:** `docs/project/phase_1_status_report.md` + `phases/phase-1-data-foundation/acceptance_criteria.md`  
**Issue:** The status report declares Phase 1 at 100% completion. The acceptance criteria document has 0/62 items checked. These are fundamentally contradictory official documents.

**Fix:** Reconcile by checking applicable ACs and adjusting the status report to reflect actual tested/verified criteria.

---

## 5. Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)

### N-1: 25+ Documents Missing Standard Headers

**Issue:** Only ~10 documents include version, status, and date metadata. The engineering standards (as expanded) now require:
```markdown
**Version:** x.y.z
**Status:** DRAFT | REVIEW | APPROVED
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Affected:** Most files in `docs/architecture/`, `docs/operations/`, `docs/security/`, `docs/project/`, `phases/`.

---

### N-2: `README.md` Needs Architecture Quick-Reference

**File:** `README.md`  
**Issue:** The root README should provide a 30-second orientation for anyone landing on the repository. It should include: project purpose, current phase, quickstart commands, and a link map to key documents.

---

### N-3: `glossary.md` Missing Phase 1.5 Terms

**File:** `docs/project/glossary.md`  
**Issue:** The glossary doesn't include Phase 1.5 terms: `ComputeMechanism`, `CloudOperatorPort`, `resource_id`, `platform_metadata`, `SERVERLESS`, `CONTAINER_INSTANCE`, `VIRTUAL_MACHINE`.

---

### N-4: Inconsistent Markdown Heading Levels

**Issue:** Some documents use `#` for the title and `##` for sections (correct). Others skip levels (e.g., jumping from `##` to `####`). This affects MkDocs rendering and TOC generation.

**Affected:** `dependency_graph.md` (jumps to `###` subsections without `##` parent), several layer detail docs.

---

### N-5: Mermaid Diagrams Not Tested for Rendering

**Issue:** Several inline Mermaid diagrams use features that may not render in all Markdown viewers (e.g., `stateDiagram-v2` nested states). No CI validation exists for Mermaid syntax.

---

### N-6: `infra/local/setup.sh` and `teardown.sh` Not Documented

**Issue:** These scripts exist but aren't referenced in the onboarding guide. The `onboarding.md` says "Assuming setup scripts exist, otherwise follow specific infra documentation" — vague hand-waving.

**Fix:** Document exact usage in `onboarding.md`.

---

### N-7: Empty `openspec/specs/` Directory

**Issue:** The directory `openspec/specs/` exists but is empty. The `openspec/changes/` subdirectories also contain empty `specs/` subdirectories.

**Fix:** Populate with actual specs or remove empty directories.

---

### N-8: `traceability.md` May Not Link to Actual Tests

**File:** `phases/phase-1-data-foundation/traceability.md`  
**Issue:** If this document traces acceptance criteria to test files, it needs updating to reflect the current test file paths and the newly identified gaps.

---

### N-9: `improvement_areas.md` May Overlap with This Document

**File:** `phases/phase-1-data-foundation/improvement_areas.md`  
**Issue:** An existing improvement areas document may contain overlapping or outdated recommendations.

---

### N-10: Runbook Documents May Reference Future Infrastructure

**Files:** `docs/operations/runbook_*.md`  
**Issue:** Runbooks for deployment, incident response, kill switch, and phase management likely reference infrastructure (Redis, ArgoCD, Helm charts) that isn't configured yet. These should be marked with "[PREREQUISITE: ...]" annotations.

---

### N-11: `FAANG_Documentation_Standards.md` May Conflict with Existing Standards

**File:** `docs/project/FAANG_Documentation_Standards.md`  
**Issue:** This meta-document about documentation standards may define rules that aren't enforced or that conflict with the now-expanded `engineering_standards.md`.

**Fix:** Reconcile the two documents or consolidate.

---

### N-12: `Technology_Stack.md` May List Uninstalled Dependencies

**File:** `docs/architecture/Technology_Stack.md`  
**Issue:** If this document lists technologies (e.g., networkx, ArgoCD, Vault) that aren't in `pyproject.toml`, it creates a misleading impression of the actual technology footprint.

---

## 7. Broken Links & Invalid References

| Source Document | Broken Reference | Correct Path | Type |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|------|
| `extensibility.md` | `src/sre_agent/ports/metric_source.py` | `src/sre_agent/ports/telemetry.py` | Wrong filename |
| `extensibility.md` | `src/sre_agent/ports/action_executor.py` | `src/sre_agent/ports/cloud_operator.py` | Wrong filename |
| `extensibility.md` | `src/sre_agent/adapters/telemetry/datadog_adapter.py` | N/A (example, not real) | Misleading example |
| `operational_readiness.md` | `docs/runbooks/agent_failure_runbook.md` | `docs/operations/runbooks/agent_failure_runbook.md` | Wrong path |
| `onboarding.md` | Links to `./architecture.md` | `../architecture/architecture.md` | Relative path wrong |
| `onboarding.md` | Links to `./features_and_safety.md` | `../security/features_and_safety.md` | Relative path wrong |
| `features_and_safety.md` | `../architecture/incident_taxonomy.md` | ✅ Valid | OK |
| `glossary.md` | Implicit link to `data_model.md` | ✅ Valid | OK |

---

## 8. Terminology Inconsistencies

| Term in Doc A | Term in Doc B | Correct Term (per code) | Fix |
|--------------|--------------|------------------------|-----|
| "DIAGNOSING" (`data_model.md`) | "ANALYZING" (codebase) | `ANALYZING` | Update docs |
| "Shadow Mode" (`roadmap.md`) | "Observe mode" (`glossary.md`) | Either — but pick one | Standardize |
| "Phase 1" (`roadmap.md` = "OBSERVE") | "Phase 1" (`phases/` = "Data Foundation") | Different "Phase 1" meanings | Disambiguate |
| "Action Executor" (`extensibility.md`) | "Cloud Operator" (codebase) | `CloudOperatorPort` | Update docs |
| "Metric Source" (`extensibility.md`) | "Telemetry Query" (codebase) | `MetricsQuery` / `TraceQuery` / `LogQuery` | Update docs |
| "Severity" as 4 levels (`features_and_safety.md`) | `AlertSeverity` as 5 levels (code has 1-5) | Verify actual enum | Align |

### Special Note: "Phase 1" Ambiguity

The term "Phase 1" is overloaded with two distinct meanings:

1. **Operational Phase 1 (OBSERVE)** — The agent's runtime mode where it only observes, never acts. Defined in `roadmap.md` as "Months 1-3."
2. **Development Phase 1 (Data Foundation)** — The build milestone for implementing telemetry ingestion, anomaly detection, and baseline learning. Defined in `phases/phase-1-data-foundation/`.

These are conceptually different but use the same name, causing confusion. Recommend using "Operational Phase" vs "Build Phase" terminology.

## 9. Missing Documentation

### Documents Referenced but Not Found

| Referenced In | Missing Document | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| `operational_readiness.md` §4 | Runbook: Agent Failure (noted "To be created") | Agent failure response procedures |
| Multiple runbooks | `.github/workflows/*.yml` | CI/CD pipeline definitions |
| `dependency_graph.md` | D3.js/Recharts dashboard docs | Visual graph rendering |
| `features_and_safety.md` | Vault/AWS SM integration guide | Secret management architecture |
| `architecture.md` | RAG pipeline design document | Intelligence Layer deep-dive |

### Documents That Should Exist but Don't

| Needed Document | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------|
| Configuration Reference (`config/README.md`) | No docs explain `agent.yaml` schema, env vars, or `settings.py` validation rules |
| API Reference (auto-generated from FastAPI) | `api/main.py` should produce OpenAPI docs; link to generated spec |
| Adapter Implementation Guide | Beyond `extensibility.md`'s brief overview — step-by-step with tests |
| Release Notes / Changelog | No version history of what was implemented when |
| Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) | No record of why specific technology choices were made |
| Migration Guide (Phase transitions) | How to upgrade the agent between operational phases |

## 10. Structural & Organizational Issues

### 10.1 Document Tree Fragmentation

Documentation is split across 6 top-level directories:
```
AGENTS.md               (root)
CONTRIBUTING.md         (root)
README.md               (root)
config/                 (config files, no docs)
docs/                   (main documentation)
  ├── api/
  ├── architecture/
  ├── operations/
  ├── project/
  └── security/
openspec/               (specs & proposals)
phases/                 (phase tracking)
```

**Problem:** A reader looking for "how does the agent detect anomalies?" could find answers in:
- `docs/architecture/architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/layers/detection_layer.md`
- `docs/architecture/layers/detection_layer_details.md`
- `phases/phase-1-data-foundation/acceptance_criteria.md` §3
- `openspec/changes/autonomous-sre-agent/design.md`

Five documents describe the same subsystem with no clear hierarchy or canonical source.

**Fix:** Establish a clear "source of truth" hierarchy:
1. `docs/architecture/` = The canonical "what it is"
2. `openspec/` = The canonical "what was specified"
3. `phases/` = The canonical "how far we've built it"

### 10.2 Layer Documents Have Redundant Summary + Detail Split

Each architectural layer has two documents:
- `detection_layer.md` (summary)
- `detection_layer_details.md` (details)

This pattern exists for all 6 layers (12 files total). The summaries are often 80% identical to the first section of the detail files.

**Fix:** Consolidate into single documents per layer. The current split adds navigation burden without proportional value.

### 10.3 Empty Directories

| Directory | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `docs/architecture/mermaid/` | Empty — no files |
| `openspec/specs/` | Empty — no files |
| `openspec/changes/autonomous-sre-agent/specs/` | Empty — no files |
| `openspec/changes/phase-1-5-non-k8s-platforms/specs/` | Empty — no files |
| `openspec/changes/archive/` | Empty — no files |

**Fix:** Populate or remove.

## 11. Per-Document Assessment

### Root-Level Documents

| Document | Quality | Issues | Recommendation |
|----------|:-------:|--------|---------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | None found. Comprehensive lock protocol, clear priority levels, Phase 1.5 examples. | Keep as-is. Gold standard doc. |
| `README.md` | ⭐⭐⭐ | Missing quickstart, current phase status, architecture diagram | Add orientation section |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | ⭐⭐ | Likely generic; needs project-specific testing and architecture rules | Expand significantly |

### Architecture Documents

| Document | Quality | Key Issues |
|----------|:-------:|-----------|
| `architecture.md` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Strong design. Missing implementation status per layer (C-5). |

| `dependency_graph.md` | ⭐⭐⭐ | References networkx (M-2), PostgreSQL (M-3). Otherwise well-structured. |
| `extensibility.md` | ⭐⭐ | Broken file paths (C-3). Would fail any contributor who follows it. |
| `incident_taxonomy.md` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Excellent. Clean, tabular, complete. No issues found. |
| `state_incident_model.md` | ⭐⭐⭐ | 10-state diagram doesn't match 5-state code enum (C-2). |
| `sequence_incident_lifecycle.md` | ⭐⭐⭐ | Likely describes aspirational flow. Needs implementation status. |
| `target_architecture.md` | ⭐⭐⭐ | Forward-looking. Should be clearly marked as "Target State". |
| `FAANG_Documentation_Standards.md` | ⭐⭐⭐ | May conflict with `engineering_standards.md`. Needs reconciliation (N-11). |
| `Technology_Stack.md` | ⭐⭐⭐ | Needs validation against `pyproject.toml` (N-12). |
